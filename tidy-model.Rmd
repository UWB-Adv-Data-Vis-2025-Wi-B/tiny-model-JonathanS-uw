## What is that sound?

In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```

## Temperature affects chirp rate

```{r temp, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate") +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)')
```

Based on a scatter plot of temperature and chirping, it seems that as temperature increases, the rate of chirping also increases.
